# Ten Is the Holiest Number

An exploration of Zeno's paradoxes in Python. The ancient Greeks would have had an easier time resolving the paradoxes if they had been able to program them in Python. (It also would have helped if they had known about calculus and the sums of infinite series.)

Also contains an exploration of the tetractys--not interesting as a mathematical proof but as an aesthetic representation of numbers. The code here allows a 10-part tetractys or one of many more parts (as long as each row in the set is 1 longer than the previous.)
